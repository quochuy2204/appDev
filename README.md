1.Confifuration Instructions

	This section contains 2 parts: hardware configuration and software configuration.

1.1Hardware congihuration

	This project is built on a Raspberry Pi3, with a USB sound card and a microphone.

	Ethernet connection is recommended. If and older version of Rpberry Pi3 is used, certain change might be necessary.

1.2 Software configurations

	First you have to set USB sound card as default audio device:

	Boot up Rasberry Pi and aplly the USB sound card.

	RPi onboard sound card doesn't have microphone interface. We have to change the default audio device to be USB sound card
	Use "lusb" command to check if your USB sound card is mouted
	Run "sudo nano /etc/asound.conf" command and put following content to the file. 
	pcm.!default{
			type plug
			slave{
				pcm "hw:1,0"
			}
		}
		ctl.!default{
			type hw
			card 1
		}
	Go back home directory. Run "nano .asoundrc" and put the same content to the file
	Run "alsamixer" to see that USB sound card is the default audio device. You can adjust the volume of mic and headphone


	Second you need to downgrade the alsa-utils from 1.0.28 to 1.0.25. To do so,we need to do all steps:
	Use "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" command and add : "deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi"
	Run "sudo apt-get update"
	Run "sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils" to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is availble
	Run "sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4" to downgrade
	Reboot
	Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working. You should see a “test.wav” file in the current folder
	Put earphone on. Run “aplay test.wav” to check that your recording is okay

2.Installation Instructions

	Download all source from Github and store in one directory
	Open terminal and change directory to source code folder
	Use command "make" to compile and link all the source code
	Change terminal to "UTF-8"
	
3.Operating Instructions

	Run "make" to make file
	Run "./wave.a" and record your sound if you want
	You will see a screen with many vertical bars and information of duration,
	bits per sample, and sample rate.
	To view the visualization, go to: http://www.cc.puv.fi/~e1601121/read_file3.php
	The visualization is real-time, so you should be able to view it like what you see in the terminal.
	To stop the program: Ctrl+C
